    <h1>B-Book Club</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>The aim  </h2>
    <p>This is to let people know the available book clubs in their surrounding</p>
    <p>This is created to lessen the burden of people looking for available </p>
        <p> clubs to attend around them</p>
        <hr>
        <p>B-Book Club was created by Mr Marh </p>
        <p>He was inspired because his profession required a lot of traveling</p>
        <p>But his love for Book didnt let him stay idle without joining a book club</p>
        <p>He found it difficult to find a book club to attend whenever he moved to a new environment</p>
